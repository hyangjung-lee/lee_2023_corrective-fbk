## `data`

The [data](data/) folder contains the processed data used to run the analyses and generate the figures.  

The [raw](data/raw/) folder contains raw behavioral data acquired for the current study, which are available both in .csv and [.mat format](data/raw/exp_data.mat). 
- [exp_data.csv](data/raw/exp_data.csv): Data consist of subject ID, condition ID (1: feedback environment manipulated to favor small choice, 2: no favor, 3:  manipulated to favor large choice), run ID, trial ID, stimulus, choice (-1: small choice / 1: large choice), class variable (-1: small class / 1: large class), correct or incorrect feedback (1: correct / 0: incorrect), and response time (sec).  


The [other_datasets](data/other_datasets/) folder contains not only the source data from the following published articles cited in this study but also the processed data for analyses (S7 Fig in Supporting Information). Both datasets were directly downloaded from the respective public repositories:

- [Urai_2017_Ncomm](data/other_datasets/Urai_2017_Ncomm/) folder contains [source data](data/other_datasets/Urai_2017_Ncomm/raw_downloaded), downloaded from [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4300043), and the [processed data](data/other_datasets/Urai_2017_Ncomm/Urai_Data_processed/).

## `reproducePaper`

To reproduce all figure items that appear in the main text and in Supporting Information, go to the [plot](plot/) folder and run .m files, which also reproduce statistical results reported in the main text as well as in the tables in Supporting Information. 

Each script is executable within the [plot](plot/) folder set as the working directory. 
- plot_Fig#.m - a script to generate one or more figure or table item(s) named after what was referred to in the paper.  

<br/>

## `model`

The [model](model/) folder contains subfolders as follows:

- [main](model/main/): contains scripts to perform model fitting, model simulation, and model recovery. 
To fit the models, go to the [main] folder, run [runme_fit.m](runme_fit.m). To perform model recovery procedure, run [runme_mdrc.m](runme_mdrc.m), which requires model simulations. Model simulator functions (simulator_MODEL.m) can also be found. 

- [func](model/func/): contains scripts needed to train models. The core part of the BMBU model proposed in the paper include [fitting_BMBU.m](model/main/func/fitting_BMBU.m) and [get_BoundLkld.m](model/main/func/get_BoundLkld.m).

- [lib_ver101](model/lib_ver101/): contains functions required to run scripts in the [model](model/) folder 
- bads-master:  [Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search (BADS)](https://github.com/acerbilab/bads) toolbox


Model fitting problems are solved via [Inverse binomial sampling](https://github.com/acerbilab/ibs), in conjunction with BADS.
